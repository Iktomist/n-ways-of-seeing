for anything around you that is in movement, try as hard as you can to work out how it moves. since nearly everything moves in some way, like the ground that appears still in front of you in relation to the changing sky, there is a lot of latitude here. try to work out the intimate physical details of that movement. how a fly manages to fly, where an insect's exoskeleton bends and flexes like a collection of joints, which parts of a tree predispose it to sway in the wind and which predispose it not to fall down, where the clouds are moving and why they hang the way they do in the atmosphere, condensing in low pressure in a way utterly foreign to the sky above your head; or else why that bank of clouds gives way to an empty sky at just the angle you are standing to a city in a county several hours' drive away, and if this represents the activity of an air current passing thousands of miles above you.
::
let your eyes wander. when they rest on something, lose your depth perception. when you tire of this, let them wander again, repeating the process a second time.
::
divide what you can see into four quadrants. label the top left a, the top right b, the bottom right c, and the bottom left d. then make a conscious effort to look at each in turn. whenever your mind wants to verbalize anything to itself, or do anything other than pay close attention to what it sees, just replace that thought with, 'i am looking at quadrant x.' periodically switch quadrants. note how crucial the bottom two quadrants are to the sense of perspective. note how often interesting things are in the lines between the quadrants.
::
pretend that, for every color in front of you, you are mixing that color using some kind of paint. try to get a feel for what that color feels like to mix, what you'd start with and what you'd add.
::
try to lose your sense of having a goal, of needing to see something in what you see. now find something in movement. an insect, a plant in the wind. observe it for a while. try to just see it move, without thinking about the fact that it is moving. try to take in as much movement as you can. after you have done this for a minute or two, try to intuit details of that thing's microscopic structure based on its movement alone. 
::
pretend that you have drunk too much coffee.
::
unfocus your eyes, lock them in place, and turn off your depth perception. now take in what you can see. now unlock your eyes, turn your depth perception back on, and let your eyes move downward or across. stop. lock your eyes in place and turn your depth perception off, but keep looking at whatever you are looking at. now unfocus your eyes, take in the big picture again, and go back to the very beginning, repeating the whole process again and again.
::
strive to see something simultaneously ancient and futuristic in what's around you. it could be something a glint on someone's face that looks like it was drawn by albrecht durer, even though that person wears headphones and hence is obviously not contemporaneous with durer. it could be the fact that the most oinsignificant seeming animal is more perfectly constructed than the best computer currently available. it could be that the same moon glow that emboldened the lunatics of old makes people today think of moon bases. be highly imaginative.
::
establish a kind of rhythm. now look around you. verbalize what you see, one word at a time, on time with the rhythm, like a list of words. strive to never repeat yourself. if you can't keep up, better to blurt out a random word than to lose your rhythm.
::
find a face. examine the expression carefully, and as you do so, try to make a very elaborate guess about what is going on in the mind of the owner of that face.
::
find a face. now, extract a single letter, vowel or consonant, from the shape of the mouth. now make up a name for the owner of that face, in which the letter you have chosen is in the rough center of the name.
::
try to gauge the relative densities of matter in everything around you. you may notice that things that suddenly seemed insignificant become highly unusual. dense objects sitting on a desk defy gravity, and a spider making its web in mid-air is an almost inexplicable anomaly.
::
realize that you are the only person who can see what is in front of you. even if someone is standing next to you, they can not see what you can see. in an effort to discover what they can see, ask the person next to you, if what you were seeing just now were a painting, what would you call it?
::
imagine that everything you see is painted using water-based media. realize that underneath all of those colors, there is just pure white paper shining through in various places as glints of light. see the way everything glows and kind of melts when you adopt this perspective.
::
find a familiar object and forget that it belongs to you.
::
forget how to breathe.
::
be precisely aware of the source of the light around you. try to appreciate the way the light reaches the things it illuminates not in straight lines but in waves that inevitably interfere with one another, creating shadows not just by failing to reach the underside of something but by canceling each other out.
::
imagine that around every corner hides your worst fear in a new disguise each time.
::
look at anything written anywhere and try to see the essence of the word's meaning in the shape of the letters.
::
find the shape of a face in something around you.
::
pick anything you can see. optionally, pick a section of that thing. now imagine that a tiny, invisible rope is drawing you and that thing closer and closer together. as you look at it, it becomes bigger and bigger. the fine details become more and more clear.
::
strive to confuse left with right and right with left inasmuch as is possible.
::
when you look at a piece of art, imagine that it's been painted with a secret technique that makes the painting animated. as such, small details of the painting may change. a person's eyes may suddenly blink, liquid in a glass may swirl around, and the sky may darken or lighten. a cloud may move, the leaves on a branch sway slightly. and in fact these changes may utterly elude you. you may find that it's impossible to truly hone in on them, due to the fact that they are always one step ahead of you. chase them.
::
Imagine a word describing what you see as if it were there in front of
it, like a label for each thing. Or imagine the words of someone
talking to you printed out in front of them as if they were a book.
::
Notice the relative vibrances of various colors around you. Which ones
are most vibrant?
::
Use equations or other aides to approximate the distance between
yourself and any thing else. They might change when the sun is
obstructed, or as a result of the time of day, or in a multitude of
ways when the sun has set.
::
Close your eyes and remember the things around you as if you were
seeing them from above. As if you're looking at things from the air,
or on a kind of cut-away view. When someone talks to you describing a
place or giving directions, close your eyes and turn all of the things
they say to you into an intricate mental picture.
::
imagine the way anything you see could be seen as a "mandala"
symbol. A tree with its various arms, a door knob, an iris, a flower's
petals; or more abstractly, a house, the sun, or anything central in
any sense. You can match them all together, making them symbols for
each other. Most things can be compared to mandalas.
::
compare anything you see to anything else you see, both things
made of similar elements -- a tree to another tree, a car to another,
a person to another. A kind of philosophical way of seeing which leads
to differentiation and categorization.
::
everything you can see is surrounded by a thick black outline, juxtaposing two and three dimensions.
::
How does the color and aspect of something you see change with
distance? Two trees may be the same color when seen from the same
distance, but they are different colors if one is close and the other
is far, because the shadows in the one far away would become less
distinct, darkening the overall color of the tree.
::
Imagine how the potrace algorithm would deal with the visual data currently coming into your eyes. Go into as much detail as possible when it comes to complicated curves.
::
Imagine yourself painting the things you see using a projector. Imagine that what is in front of you is solid, being touched and copied onto a hard surface in front of you.
::
Notice the three most prominent colors around you. What are they, and
what is their relative level of prominence.
::
is there enough direct sunlight to see anything around you cast a shadow? does one of those things happen to be in movement? if so, try tracking the movement of the shadow and the object simultaneously. try tracing the angles of the light rays, try noticing the subtle rotation of the object as projected in shadow and the effect of this rotation on the proportions of the shadow.
::
everything you see vibrates in time by being born and dying.
a tree has a longer wavelength than an insect.
a mineral has a longer wavelength than both.
look around you and be aware of these wavelengths.
::
imagine a regular grid dividing up everything you can see,
highlighting relative sizes of things. Useful for comparing
proportions.
::
everything around you is information. this can be interpreted in a number of different ways.
::
Watch the things in movement around you, and notice how they move.
This is very relaxing on a nice day with a breeze.
::
the images in front of you are like footprints in the sand.
imagine their eventual disappearance, like beats of a drum.
::
look very very closely; in the manual language of chlorophyll, the plants around you are signing things like 'isn't it great to be a plant!' and 'i'm delicious!'
::
sort the colors you see into color zones, like "paint by numbers."
Zones can be made of identical colors, or colors with the same base.
They could even be made of colors and their complimentary colors. The
key is that you're matcing colors in different parts of your vision
based on an association. Try to order the color zones hierarchically,
so that you're keeping track of all of them at the same time. You can
do this based on value. You can also sort the values you see into
zones, which is essentially performing 1, then 9.
::
match the colors around you by chroma. the colors you are matching should look as if they have the same weight. if they were suddenly a black and white photograph, they would be roughly the same shade of gray.
::
match the colors around you by split complementation. strive not to do this analytically, but to do it by feeling the distances between colors. if one color is violet, the split complement should be near yellow, but not yellow. it could be green instead. if one color is green, the split complement should be near red, but not red. it could be orange instead. if one color is blue, the split complement should be near orange, but not orange. it could be red instead.
::
you turn off your speech and language centers as much as is possible. just this.
::
Close your eyes and strive to take a "memory picture" of what you see.
Open your eyes, check for accuracy, then close them and add extra
detail. Repeat until you get that strange feeling in your heart.
::
imagine the way anything you see could be seen as fire: a tree with its various arms, the entire hundred thousand year history of your planet; a flower's petals; you can match them together, making them symbols for each other. most things are impermanent, hence can be compared as such.
::
Imagine what you see as having a role in a fairytale you create.
::
look at everything as if it were an oil painting by someone from the late renaissance, like tintoretto or titian; notice the vibrance of colors and their harmony.
::
Where are you? Where does it remind you of being? Does it remind you
of a dream? You may notice that you feel a little amnesic, as if you'd
just dropped into another world, when you forget where you are, in
order to notice it more, so that you can be reminded of something
else.
::
imagine something that is not there: an object, a color, a change
of size, perspective, or another of limitless possibilities. When
someone talks to you, you close your eyes and imagine vivid mental
images.
::
Everything you see can be thought of as a two dimensional projection.

Imagine a grid, and lay it on top of that projection.

Place stones at the intersections of the grid, forming geometric shapes.
::
imagine the way anything you see would feel if touched. Socks,
coats, clouds, glass, or anything at all.
::
Be very sensitive to all of the details your eyes allow you to see.
Act as if life were a CG movie and you were constantly remarking how
well it had been drawn by a computer.
::
imagine that what you see in front of you is a japanese woodcut.
::
how many degrees of freedom do the things around you have? how much do they move or not move before they are unmade?
::
something mysterious highlights and accentuates any unusual color.
::
Zoom in on something you see in your imagination: imagine what it
looks like when seen up close.
::
everything around you does not have a proper name, instead it has a name based on what it does or is essentially.
::
everything you see is a black and white photograph. You
convert the colors in your head like drawing a pencil sketch on your
imagination's white space. Alternately, you turn all of the values
negative, imagining everything you see like a photographic negative.

enlightenment is when all the seven colors of the rainbow are just variations on green. look around you and imagine that everything you can see is monochrome in one single color.
::
move and notice the way this changes the size, position, and
appearance of things. Like in certain movies where a shot is taken
from a moving vehicle.
::
everything in front of you, if you look very very closely, is writing. there is about one page of readable text for every square milimeter. stand still, look, and try to read it.
::
draw imaginary lines between points standing still, noticing the
arrangement of objects as projections into two-dimensions. When you
move, you note the way these lines shift in relation to one another,
as the result of a perspective shift.
::
Move your eyes around jerkily in every direction, either at random or
according to a shape's pattern. Notice the things that you were seeing
out of the corners of your eyes without knowing.
::
you are a tiny driver inside a huge body.
You are a tiny spark of consciousness inside of your skull. This body you inhabit is a gigantic robot. Based on this realization, see the world anew. The flowers would tower above you, if you were not securely placed at the helm of your vehicle, using levers and pulleys to control its legs and arms.
::
Notice the levels of illumination and brightness around you. Notice
when they change, and how that influences everything you see.
